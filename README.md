## Overview

Nodot is a node composition library built for Godot 4, aimed at simplifying the game development process. It provides ready-to-use nodes that encapsulate common game mechanics, allowing you to build complex gameplay without having to start from scratch or write extensive scripts. Nodot enables you to create anything from a first-person character controller to a complex inventory system by simply dragging and dropping components into your scene.

The inspiration behind Nodot stems from years of working with Godot and realizing the need for an easier, more intuitive approach to building games. Many game developers, especially those working solo or in small teams, find themselves bogged down by the technical complexities of setting up and coding common game elements. Nodot seeks to bridge that gap by offering reusable building blocks that can be customized through Godot's node system.

Nodot is designed for anyone who wants to focus more on the creative aspects of game design and less on repetitive coding tasks. With Nodot, even those who may not be comfortable writing GDScript can build fully functional games.

## Why Nodot?

Creating games often requires setting up a lot of foundational systems: character movement, item management, AI behavior, HUDs, and more. Nodot provides pre-made solutions for these common game elements so that you don't have to build them from scratch each time. The goal is to reduce the technical barrier for creators who may struggle with the more code-heavy aspects of game development, making it easier for anyone to jump in and start creating.

### Key Features:

- **Drag-and-Drop Simplicity**: Most of the components in Nodot are designed so you can drop them into your scene, configure their properties via the GUI, and start using them right awayâ€”no scripting required.
- **Extensible**: If you want to extend the functionality of Nodot nodes, you can easily do so by inheriting from them in GDScript. This allows for both flexibility and ease of use.
- **Focus on Common Game Components**: Nodot includes nodes for player movement, inventory systems, AI behavior, physics, and more. These are things you often find yourself needing to code from scratch, but with Nodot, they're ready to go.
- **Open and Community-Driven**: Although Nodot began as a personal project, it aims to be shaped by the needs of the community. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome.
